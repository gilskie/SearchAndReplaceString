# Text Search and Replace
 Application will read an input file location which could contain an xml file or any readable file and then apply a regular expression based on the table file configuration(e.g. SearchString|||ExpectedTransformationString). An output file will be made once all of the table contents has been processed. 
 
 Table file dropdown allows user to filter specific file extension therefore those only selected are the ones processed.

 User can also add specific validations of which regular expression is being used. If certain validation has matches on the file itself it will include it on the applications display.
